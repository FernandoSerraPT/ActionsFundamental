# Add the triggers to the worklow with the help of Ctrl+Space and the documentation. We want the workflow to trigger:
# on every push to the main branch, but not when there are changes to files in the .github folder.
# on every pull request with main as the base branch
# Every sunday at 6:15 UTC
# Manually

# Create a job Build that runs on the latest Ubuntu image on GitHub hosted runners. Check the documentation of the virtual environments what label to use and what version it is. The job should do the following things:
# Output the name of the event that triggered the workflow
# Output the name of the branch that the repository is currently referencing
# List all files in the repository

# Test: runs on ubuntu-latest after Build. Only runs when the workflow was triggered manually. 
#       Runs on the environment Test. The job writes Testing... to the workflow log.
# Load-Test: runs on ubuntu-latest after Build. Only runs when the workflow was triggered manually. 
# Runs on the environment Load-Test. The job writes Testing... to the workflow log and sleeps for 15 seconds.
# Production: runs on ubuntu-latest after Test and Load-Test. Deploys to the environment Production onyl if this was selected as the input parameter. 
#             The environment has the URL https://writeabout.net. To simulate deployment, the job will execute 5 steps. 
#             Each step with writes Step x deploying... to the workflow log and sleeps for 10 seconds.
